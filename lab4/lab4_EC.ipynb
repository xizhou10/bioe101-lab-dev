    "\n",
    "- Learn about cardiac signals and EKG measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply theory of interference, CMRR, noise, and instrumentation amplifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build filters for signal conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain practical experience with soldering and protoboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interface conditioned analog signals with digital logic in Arduino and Python\n",

    "**<span style=\"color:red\">NOTE: This lab involves the use of electrodes directly coupled to skin. Please STOP\n",
    "and CALL a TA if you are uncomfortable with using these electrodes, or if you feel\n",
    "tingling/dizziness from wearing them. ALWAYS ASK if you are uncertain of a circuit\n",

    "-  Week 1: Prototype an EKG amplifier on a breadboard and test it on a live human\n",
    "subject. Entire pre-lab is due at the beginning of the lab.\n",

    "- Week 2: Read out your EKG data to the Arduino and get fancy for extra credit. The entire lab report is due the\n",
