# bioe101-lab-dev

These are the labs for BIOE101 (Bioinstrumentation) with Professor Steve Conolly at UC Berkeley. In Spring 2017, we revamped our labs to use the Arduino microcontroller instead of the outdated NIDAQ, with graduate student instructors Xinyi Zhou and Nicole Repina, and undergraduate lab assistants Quincy Huynh and Andrew Hild.
